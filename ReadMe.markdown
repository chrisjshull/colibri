###### Color history view:

1. The color you copy goes in this stack and the string representation to the pasteboard.
2. Drag and drop a color anywhere: Applications, System Color Picker or Folders. 
3. Double click on a color to remove it from the stack.

###### Global mode:

1. Added Hot key to copy. (for now read-only setting)

###### Known issue (Applies to any app using CG):

Apple Core Graphics API has a hard time with some GL Views (Apps, Games); misinterpreting the composite mask 
(anyway rare, in Radar, I was lucky to catch that, e.g randomly testing Colibri CPU usage on various views 
invalidating a lot). Syndrome: the magnifier will paint a green color (mask) you might time to time perceive 
our friend Roswell 8-) too. For any complaints you take the 101, then Exit Toward University Avenue 
(You know the Big IKEA, made for people like us(TM)), then make a left on Middlefield (... BIP ...) stop at 
the first House with (... BIP ...) on the rigth you can see (... BIP ...) with (... BIP ...) that's the # (... BIP ...) of (... BIP ...) kidding 8-).

#### Version 1.1.1

1. CPU usage and memory optimization. (maximum top noted with strong repaints e.g a video playing: 9.2% of CPU usage versus Apple (macbook pro, 12% on mac mini snow) !DigitalColor Meter: 44.8% and sometimes more).
2. Added activate/deactivate mouse moved event listener when the application is hidden (was really bad in term of CPU) or the window is miniaturized.
3. Removed discard mouse moved event when the window is miniaturized.
